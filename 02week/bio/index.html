                        <p>I have more than a decade of Project Management experience in the biotech industry releasing new products from development to final product. <br />
                            I began in biotech industry at 17-years old and after moving to Austin, TX, I continued in the biotech industry. 
                        </p>
                            <p>I have a strong passion for photography, graphic design, and page layouts. 
                               I attended Austin Community College and received an Associate of Applied Science, Graphic Arts Technology in 2014 with a focus in print.
                               As the times have changes with smart phones, so does the way we receive our information. <br />
                               I am currently learning how to create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a freelance graphic design that knows how to code.
